                <h2>Hire Me!</h2>
                <p>I am a hardworking, dedicated sports journalist willing to help out any potential employer as they need, whether it be a job or freelance work.
                    Working as a sports writer at Times Media Group has taught me a lot on how to work for a publication and the importance of meeting deadlines.
                    During my time at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, I have learned from so many successful journalists and developed my skills in every
                    aspect, especially for writing and video broadcast work. Because of my business minor, I also took a web design course that helped me to code
                    this website for myself. I have a good grasp for writing in a variety of ways, using cameras and working in Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop and
                    Audition. Through all of my experiences, I am working to be the best version of myself I can be and hope to be. </p><br />
                <h2>What I Want to Be</h2>
                <p>My main goal is to be a sportswriter for a team, newspaper, website or other content provider. As I gain more experience in the field of journalism,
                    I hope to become a more proficient writer and well-rounded in all of its aspects. When it is all said and done, I want to look back on a career
                    filled with lots of exciting experiences and earn many accolades as a sports journalist.</p><br /><br />
