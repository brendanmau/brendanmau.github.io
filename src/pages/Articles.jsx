                        TUCSON – On the first drive of the game against
                        Colorado, Arizona QB Jayden de Laura threw a quick
                        backwards pass to freshman WR Tetairoa McMillan.
                        McMillan looked down the field on the trick play to
                        throw to an open receiver, but could not find anyone, so
                        he ran to the other side of the backfield, looking like
                        he was going to turn downfield, but then he checked down
                        a pass to de Laura, who made a nice catch along the
                        sideline for an 11-yard gain.
